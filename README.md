# trivia
Trivia homework is an example of using the time functions (setTimeout).
in this example i tried to step into detaching the data from the main logic file. that will make the logic file cleaner.
the content is built by javascript, that means the project can be scalable and can add more questions. also, the total time will change depending on the number of questions.
